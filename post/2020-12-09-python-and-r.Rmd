```{R}

#Introduction

R and Python are two different programming languages that can do many similar things. I have mainly worked with R for statistical purposes (like making nice graphs!) and feel like I'm finally getting the hang of it :)

Python, on the other hand, remains a mystery (especially regex) but is also immensely useful for statistics and other coding purposes. 

Reticulate allows you to share things between R and Python. For example, if you want to use Python to manipulate a dataset in R, reticulate allows you to do that. 

#Example

Here's R code.

```{R}
library(nycflights13)
library(tidyverse)

flights<-flights

head(flights)
flights %>% summarize(mean(distance))
```


Here's Python code. Notice how it takes the flight dataset from R simply by adding some notation to the beginning of the line.

```{python}
r.flights.distance.mean()
```
