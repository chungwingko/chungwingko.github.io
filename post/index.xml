      <description>library(reticulate) Introduction R and Python are two different programming languages that can do many similar things. I have mainly worked with R for statistical purposes (like making nice graphs!) and feel like I&#39;m finally getting the hang of it :)
Python, on the other hand, remains a mystery (especially regex) but is also immensely useful for statistics and other coding purposes.
Reticulate allows you to share things between R and Python.</description>
