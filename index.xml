      <description>I found three datasets through the World Bank Databank, found here: https://databank.worldbank.org/home.aspx. Datasets can be filtered based on countries, statistics, and years. I chose statistics from Gender Statistics, Poverty Statistics, and Sustainable Development Goals, using the year 2015 as the base year for all three datasets. The Gender Statistics dataset contained these variables: GDP, Death rate, Adolescent fertility rate, and Age dependency ratio. The Poverty Statistics dataset contains the Population statistic, and the Sustainability Development Goals dataset contains CO2 emissions per capita, Forest area, Renewable resource consumption, and Access to drinking water services.</description>

      <description>library(reticulate) Introduction R and Python are two different programming languages that can do many similar things. I have mainly worked with R for statistical purposes (like making nice graphs!) and feel like I&#39;m finally getting the hang of it :)
Python, on the other hand, remains a mystery (especially regex) but is also immensely useful for statistics and other coding purposes.
Reticulate allows you to share things between R and Python.</description>
